## Test task for First AML with React

After pulling, in root folder please create .env file with name `.env.development.local`.
Add content `REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3016` to be able to run the app.

- Task number 1 (display list with client pagination) and 4 (create horse) are completed
- A few tests to cover tasks requirements, could be more but time restrictions
- Only react and react-dom as runtime dependencies
- App component needs to be refactored: business logic could be extracted out as a custom hook and functions.
- First time using this react-testing-library, took a bit of time to get used to it
